# Battle Puffs
Battle Puffs features four cute puffs, from which the player selects one to battle with. The selected puff will need to battle the remaining three to win the game. Each stat and name is generated randomly to add diversity to the game play. The selected puff's attack grows stronger as it battles the others. Choose your puff and the order you battle the enemies wisely to win the game.
